# Hexicon
Hexicon is a magic mod semi-inspired by Ars Magica and Ars Noveau aiming to create a more vanilla-style (for now, I'm not sure about future plans) magic system

Instead of only being able to create magic in books, wizards must start their journey by verbalizing their spells until they learn to enchant books.

And instead of separate spellbook items, wizards must make use of the books already in vanilla minecraft and build around them.

There is also a unique mana system: mana is not passively regenerated. Mages must restock on mana before they leave their homes.

# Gameplay

While Hexicon can be fun to play around with in singleplayer, it tries to shine in multiplayer PVP or PVE scenarios (it'll take some balancing)

Even non-magic users can fight back if they attempt to dry out their opponent's mana by sustaining attacks like being raised into the air.

Instead of providing easy ways to mine and damage like Ars Noveau, it forces players to think outside the box about how to do these tasks with magic.

# Future Updates

After the main content for Hexicon for 1.16 is done, I will probably port it to 1.18 and do updates there until the next major mod version.

From there, porting it to Fabric will be decently easy (at least I think) because most of the word logic is just java code, I'll only need to implement a few hooks.

# My Code Sucks

I'm not good at Java (and programming in general) so the code for this is probably not organized and slower than what it could be. 

Please tell me if you know how to fix these issues! I think the file in items/custom/Words under the Hexicon package is particularly bad but I'm not good at this.
