# Hexicon
Hexicon is a magic mod semi-inspired by Ars Magica and Ars Noveau aiming to create a more vanilla-style (for now, I'm not sure about future plans) magic system

Instead of only being able to create magic in books, wizards must start their journey by verbalizing their spells until they learn to enchant books.

And instead of separate spellbook items, wizards must make use of the books already in vanilla minecraft and build around them.

There is also a unique mana system: mana is not passively regenerated. Mages must restock on mana before they leave their homes.
