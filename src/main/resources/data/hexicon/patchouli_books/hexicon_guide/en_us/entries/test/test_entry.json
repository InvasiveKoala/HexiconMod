      "type": "patchouli:text",
      "text": "“Oriri” means to raise or rise. “Valde” means “very”. “Proxima” means nearest, and “lupus” means dog. The sentence means “Raise very nearest dog” literally, but it has a different inferred meaning. Using “very” with most verbs enhances their effect, so it is making the dog get raised higher. These sentences are also not direct translations and wouldn’t make grammatical sense in English. The sentence actually means “raise the nearest dog”."
